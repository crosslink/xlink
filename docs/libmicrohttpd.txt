What it doesn't mention is the alternatives to MHD_HEADER_KIND. You don't need to parse the "Referer:" header yourself, as I was about to fall back on; you just need to look at the MHD_GET_ARGUMENT_KIND values. (Or, if it's cookies you're wanting, MHD_COOKIE_KIND.)

Even better, given that you probably know the name of the cookie, GET argument, or header you're looking for in any real code, there's MHD_lookup_connection_value. Here's how you'd get the value of a GET argument called "q", for example:

  const char* q = MHD_lookup_connection_value(connection, MHD_GET_ARGUMENT_KIND, "q");
Don't go putting that straight into a std::string, because libmicrohttpd returns NULL for missing values.
